Running the Tests
To run the tests, use the following command:


npx playwright test assignment.spec.js --ui
npx playwright test tasks.spec.js


The first command will run the tests for the assignment, while the second command will run the tests for the tasks.

Configuration
You can configure the tests by modifying the test files (assignment.spec.js and tasks.spec.js). Feel free to update the test cases, add new ones, or customize the test environment as needed.
